Use Cases : What are they? -L. Massa-Lochridge, VM-WG Chair, Editor

Our group has adopted the traditional notion of use cases as scenarios in which actors interact with a system or process or model being developed. The use cases are not the mathematical models nor any elements of this standard or specification. Use cases are ways in which the elements of this standard may be applied. 

The primary purpose of the use case is to help identify features or characteristics that the representation of the universe being modeled must satisfy in order to correctly perform some function or to satisfy requirements.

In the Elections Administration domain, use cases are scenarios in which one or more models or reusable component models of counting, tabulation, mathematical evaluation, or common operations performed on vote selection and cast vote records data sets, are applied in real world elections administration processes of interest.

For example, scenarios include applying reusable component models in the context of particular requirements such as 'all EA processes must be auditable', or requirements that a system support verifiability, or where encryption schemes are implemented, for the case of reporting aggregations, etc.

I.e., the use cases should be a set of different scenarios or activities in which the work product may be applied. 

It is the nature of our work that it is cross-cutting. It is applicable across common elections administration processes, and across interoperability use cases that are technology specific (E.g. .

The approved project scope does not limit our universe to major voting system varieties nor to a single level of generalization versus specificity or granularity.
